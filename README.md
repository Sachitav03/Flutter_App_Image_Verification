# Flutter_App_Image_Verification
This project is a basic Flutter application demonstrating AI integration using TensorFlow Lite for image classification. It includes a simple user interface with navigation and uses Material Design components such as AppBar, FloatingActionButton, and Scaffold. The app loads a TensorFlow Lite model to classify images and display the results in a user-friendly manner.

**Features:**
AI Model Integration: Uses TensorFlow Lite to load a model and classify an image.
Material Design Components: Built with Flutterâ€™s Scaffold for structuring the UI, along with AppBar, FloatingActionButton, and other core widgets.
Basic Navigation: Includes navigation from the main screen to an AI feature screen.
Logging: Provides debug information using the logging package to help track model loading.

**Code Structure:**
main.dart: Entry point of the app. Sets up navigation and theming.
ai_feature.dart: Contains the logic for loading the TensorFlow Lite model and running image classification.
Known Issues
Image Classification: The image classification feature is currently facing issues where the model does not produce expected results. This could be due to incorrect image paths, model compatibility, or other configuration problems.

**Future Improvements:**
Debugging Model Integration: Investigating and fixing issues with TensorFlow Lite model execution.
Optional Blockchain/Web3 Features: Exploring possible Web3 integrations in future iterations.
Enhancing UI: Improving the visual design and user interaction flow.
